* Foreign words according to the language spoken in the text
* For example, "adab" is a foreign word in Dune in the context
* of the standard language spoken by characters. In the same novel
* "Kwisatz Haderach" is a foreign word in the first chapters, when it
* is new for the main character. Later it becomes a common word.
* Another example: "ent" is not a foreign word in The Lord of the Rings
* being part of the Common Speech, while "éored" is foreign since it
* is a word in the Rohirric language, but the conversation between Aragorn
* and Éomer is being held in Common Speech.
